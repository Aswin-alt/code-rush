## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ASM Bytecode Analysis
- Deep class structure analysis
- Method complexity calculation
- Dependency graph construction
- Pattern recognition algorithms

### Risk Scoring Algorithm
```
Risk Score = (Dependent Count × 10) + Sum(Dependent Complexities)
- Critical: 50+ (Do not remove)
- Moderate: 20-49 (Test thoroughly)
- Low: 0-19 (Safe to remove)
```
